## Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

#### positioning schemes in css:
- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning

## To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
**box offset** properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.

- Fixed Positioning 
- Floating Elements

When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap.
**The z-index property** allows you to control which box appears 
 also If you want to control which
element sits on top, you can use
the **z-index property**. Its value
is a number, and the higher the
number the closer that element
is to the front. For example, an
element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one
with a z-index of 5.
on top.
#### the postion in Css
- Normal flow :position:static
- position:relative
- position:absolute
- position:fixed

## float
The float property allows you to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

## Many web pages use multiple columns 
in their design. This
is achieved by using a <div>
element to represent each column
