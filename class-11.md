**You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS**

**To align images**. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:
- The float property  
- New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page

**By default, images are inline elements**
 This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block.

## The background-repeat 
**property can have four values:**
- **repeat** :The background image is
repeated both horizontally and vertically 
- repeat-x : The image is repeated
horizontally only 
- repeat-y : The image is repeated vertically only.
- no-repeat : The image is only shown once


## The background-attachment :
property specifies whether a background image should **stay** in
one position or move as the user
**scrolls up** and down the page.
 It can have one of two values:
- **fixed** :The background image stays in
the same position on the page.
- **scroll** :The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.

### only When an image is not being repeated
we can use the background-position
