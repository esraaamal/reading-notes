## Tables
Use the four key elements for creating tables
Basic Table Structure:
The **table** element is used
to create a table ,The **tr** element stands for table row,The **td** stands for
table data,The **th** element is used just
like the **td** element but its
purpose is to represent the
***heading for either a column or a row***. 
(The **th** stands for table heading)
we can use the **scope** attribute
on the **th** element to indicate whether it is a heading for a
column or a row.

#### Spanning Rows
The rowspan attribute can be
used on a **th** or **td** element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.

**There are three** elements that
help distinguish between the
main content of the table and
the first and last rows (which can
contain different content)
- thead(The headings of the table should sit inside the **thead** element)
- tbody(The body should sit inside the **tbody** element. )
- tfoot( The footer belongs inside the **tfoot** element.)

### object
To update the value of properties we use dot notation or sequer brackets 
Object created using literal or constructor notationâ€¦

**we Create many object constructor notaion because sometimes we want several object to represent similar things**
So object constructor can use a function as atemplate for creating object

no need to build many objects to the similar type of
 description so we create a single object called a template
   containing the main properties ..that any similar object can access this template
