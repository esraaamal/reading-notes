### Links 
***The element (a) uses the href attribute to indicate the page we are linking to,The href has an url ,URl: stand for Uniform resources  locator, When we are linking to other pages within the same site, we do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. we can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.***

**Email Links: href attribute starts with mailto, and  followed by the email address  you want the email to be sent to. If we want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.**
**We can also use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to**

### Layout :
- Controlling the position of elements 
- Creating site layouts 
- Designing for different sized screens

***Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element, To indicate where a box should be positioned , use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed and When we  move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows us to control which box appears on top.***


#### CSS has the following positioning schemes:
- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning




### FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS BUILT-IN METHODS OBJECTS 
Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped 
together because perform a specific task

### OBJECTS
***programmers use objects a set of objects that act that have been grouped to create models of the like a toolkit for creatingtogether*** because they world using data if Iâ€™m goning  to ask the function to perform it taske ,we need calling function,some function need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task these information calld parameters,but befor all these steps we have to Declaring a function then we can calling the function ,the result of function can be single value out of a function
or a multi value
**HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK: Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.**



### pair programming is:
 the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
he Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer

### Reasons for Pair Programming
-	Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
